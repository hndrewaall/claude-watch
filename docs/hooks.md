# Hooks + obligations gate

Claude Code hooks let the harness intercept tool invocations and either DENY
them (PreToolUse) or react after they finish (PostToolUse). The
`tools/hooks/` directory ships a set of canonical hook scripts that wire
into the obligations gate (`tools/obligations/`) and the session-task queue
(`tools/session-task/`).

## Wiring

In `~/.claude/settings.json` (after `make install` puts the binaries in
`~/bin/`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Agent",
        "hooks": [
          {"type": "command", "command": "~/bin/pre-agent-queue-gate-hook", "timeout": 5}
        ]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {"type": "command", "command": "~/bin/pre-tool-obligations-gate-hook", "timeout": 5}
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Read",
        "hooks": [
          {"type": "command", "command": "~/bin/post-tool-mark-attachment-read-hook", "timeout": 5}
        ]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {"type": "command", "command": "~/bin/post-tool-obligations-update-hook", "timeout": 5}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Hook scripts

| Script | Hook event | Matcher | Purpose |
|--------|------------|---------|---------|
| `pre-agent-queue-gate-hook` | PreToolUse | `Agent` | Refuses `Agent` spawns missing a `Queue item: q-XXXX` marker, or whose marker isn't `running` in the queue. |
| `pre-tool-obligations-gate-hook` | PreToolUse | `*` | Calls `obligations check`; denies when a gate-mode obligation's predicate is unsatisfied. Also enforces a built-in cardinal rule against bare `watcher-ctl run` (must be invoked via the harness `run_in_background:true`). |
| `post-tool-obligations-update-hook` | PostToolUse | `*` | Runs `obligations post-tool` (satisfy-by-completion + inform-mode advisories) and manages a sidecar registry for `no_pending_watcher_outputs`. |
| `post-tool-mark-attachment-read-hook` | PostToolUse | `Read` | Auto-marks external-messaging attachments as read via a host-specific `*-mark-read` shim when Claude opens a file under a configured attachment dir. Host-specific integration; safe no-op when neither the shim nor the dir is present. |

All hooks default-open on internal error. A broken hook must NEVER blackhole
the loop.

## Obligations gate

`obligations` is a generic "must do X before Y" enforcement layer for the
harness — the structural fix for "I'll always X" verbal commitments that
evaporate from context. State at `~/.config/claude/obligations.json` (0600,
fcntl.flock-protected).

CLI: `obligations add | list | show | satisfy | override | prune | check |
post-satisfy | inform-check | post-tool` (`obligations --help` for full
surface).

### Predicate vocabulary (BOUNDED)

| Predicate | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `file_mtime_within {path, max_age_secs}` | file was modified recently |
| `file_exists {path, negate?}` | file is/isn't present |
| `marker_file_present {path, negate?}` | alias of `file_exists` |
| `env_present {var, value?}` | env var set (and optionally equals value) |
| `queue_status {id, status}` | queue item in expected state |
| `no_pipe_pattern {regex}` | BAN regex against Bash command |
| `process_alive {pid_file}` | PID in file is alive |
| `process_in_pgrep {pattern}` | pattern matches via `pgrep -f` |
| `watchers_healthy {}` | `watcher-status --unhealthy-only` is empty |
| `is_main_loop {negate?}` | main-loop call vs subagent (scope guard) |
| `agent_inbox_empty {path}` | `agent-msg` inbox has no unread messages |
| `stale_ready_queue_present {threshold_secs?, queue_path?}` | BAN — true iff NO ready-now queue item has been waiting `>= threshold_secs` (default 300s). Failure carries the offending ids in `why`. |
| `all_of {predicates: [...]}` | meta-predicate (logical AND, with `is_main_loop` scope-guard short-circuit) |
| `no_pending_watcher_outputs {}` | every `tasks/*.output` sidecar has been Read |

Extend the CLI when you need more — don't shoehorn.

### Tool patterns

`*` | `Bash` | `Bash:<regex>` (Bash whose command matches regex) | `<ToolName>`.

### Enforcement modes

- `gate` (default): PreToolUse hook DENIES the matching tool call when the
  predicate is unsatisfied. The classic obligation: "must do X before Y".
- `inform`: PreToolUse never blocks. Instead, PostToolUse evaluates the
  predicate after every matching tool call and prints a single-line
  stderr banner if it's unsatisfied. Use for soft surfacing ("watcher
  health is degraded") that should be visible without blocking forward
  progress.

Pass `--enforcement inform` on `obligations add` to register a non-blocking
advisory.

### Predicate composition

To scope an obligation to the main loop only, register
`predicate: all_of [is_main_loop {}, <other>]` — the `is_main_loop` child
acts as a scope-guard.

`all_of` semantics: standard logical AND, with one short-circuit. If any
child is `is_main_loop` and that child FAILS (context doesn't match), the
entire `all_of` returns satisfied=True ("scope-guard inactive"); the
obligation does not block. The natural "main-loop only enforce X" pattern.

Detection signal: per Claude Code's hook contract, the PreToolUse /
PostToolUse JSON payload carries an `agent_id` field ONLY when the call is
from inside a subagent; main-loop calls have no `agent_id` (or empty).
Both hooks extract `payload.agent_id` and forward it to the obligations CLI
via `--agent-id`.

### Auto-satisfaction

Pass `--satisfied-by-tool X --satisfied-by-cmd-regex Y` to `obligations add`,
and the PostToolUse hook removes the obligation as soon as a matching tool
call completes.

### `exempt_patterns`

Each obligation may carry an `exempt_patterns` list (same syntax as
`tool_pattern`). The obligation applies iff its `tool_pattern` matches AND
no entry in `exempt_patterns` matches. Use to encode "this gate exists but
the recovery path must always be allowed even when the predicate is
failing". Pass `--exempt-tool-pattern <pat>` (repeatable) on `add`.

### Universal recovery exempts (deadlock floor)

Per-obligation `exempt_patterns` is opt-in: an author can forget to list a
recovery surface, and two such obligations whose exempt sets do not
overlap form a deadlock-in-waiting. To prevent this structurally, the
framework applies a fixed list of `UNIVERSAL_RECOVERY_EXEMPT_PATTERNS`
BEFORE per-obligation evaluation. Tools matching this list are allowed
past every active obligation regardless of per-row configuration.

The universal recovery surface:

- `Bash:^obligations\b` — the escape hatch itself (override/satisfy/prune/
  list/show/check/post-tool). MUST always work to break a deadlock.
- `Bash:^session-task\b` — the dispatcher's queue control surface (queue
  register/spawn-check/done/abandon/add/promote/heartbeat/show/list/
  banner/prune/set-summary plus the layer-1 set/clear/get helpers).
- `Agent` — spawning subagents is the dispatcher's primary recovery
  action.
- `Bash:^watcher-(ctl|status|restart)\b` — watcher-health recovery.
- `Bash:^(pgrep|pkill|ps)\b` — process diagnosis.
- `Read:tasks/[^"]+\.output` — captured-watcher-output Read (the
  satisfier for `no_pending_watcher_outputs`).
- `Bash:^self-clear\b` — controlled context-clear path.

Inform-mode obligations honor the universal exempts too: when the caller
is on the recovery path, repeating "watcher X is DOWN" is noise. Per-row
overrides (audited overrides) are still the preferred targeted bypass
when something OUTSIDE the recovery surface needs to fire while a gate
is active.

Design rule for any new obligation: the row-level `exempt_patterns` is
about ROW-SPECIFIC accommodations (e.g. "the SATISFIER for THIS gate is
Bash:^foo"). The universal recovery floor handles the cross-cutting
escape hatch + dispatcher + watcher recovery cases. Don't duplicate them
on every row.

### Audited overrides

```
obligations override "<reason>" --duration <60|5m|1h>
```

Short-TTL bypass that disables ALL gate-mode obligations for the duration
(hard cap 24h). Self-clears via TTL; cancel early via
`obligations satisfy <ov-id>`. Audited at create time AND on every call it
bypasses to `~/.config/claude/obligations-bypass.log`. Surfaces in
`obligations list` as "ACTIVE OVERRIDES". Inform-mode advisories are NOT
silenced (overrides gate forward progress, not visibility).

Override creation also fires a low-priority push notification via
`pingme` (when present on `$PATH`) carrying `<ov-id> (<duration>): <reason>`,
so an audited bypass surfaces on the operator's phone in addition to the
log. The `pingme` shim is host-pluggable — point it at whatever
notification service you use. Suppress in tests / CI via
`OBLIGATIONS_DISABLE_PINGME=1`.

### Emergency bypass (legacy)

- `OBLIGATIONS_BYPASS=1` — allows any tool call, audited to
  `~/.config/claude/obligations-bypass.log`.
- `QUEUE_GATE_BYPASS=1` — bypasses the `pre-agent-queue-gate-hook`,
  audited to `~/.config/claude/queue-gate-bypass.log`.

Prefer `obligations override` — scoped TTL + audit reason, vs always-on
env-var pollution.

### Default-open

If the `obligations` CLI is missing, JSON parse fails, or any internal
error happens, the hook logs to `~/.config/claude/obligations-hook-errors.log`
and allows the call. Same semantics for `watchers_healthy` if
`watcher-status` is missing or hangs.

## Tests

```
make test-hooks            # 70+ cases covering every predicate,
                           # enforcement mode, exempt-patterns,
                           # overrides, and the watcher-ctl cardinal-rule
                           # gate. Runs against an isolated $HOME tmpdir.
```
