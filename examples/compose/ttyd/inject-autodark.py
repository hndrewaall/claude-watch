# Inject autodark CSS + xterm.js theme-swap JS into ttyd's bundled HTML.
#
# Why: ttyd 1.7.7 ships a single self-contained index.html (~730 KB) that
# inlines all CSS + the xterm.js JS bundle. The default body background
# is white. xterm.js itself respects the theme= ttyd command-line option,
# but the page chrome (everything outside the terminal renderer
# rectangle) stays white. macOS Safari in system dark mode then shows a
# white frame around a dark terminal — visually broken.
#
# This script:
#   1. Reads the upstream HTML (captured at build time via a one-shot
#      ttyd run + wget — see Dockerfile).
#   2. Injects a <style> block that uses @media (prefers-color-scheme)
#      to recolor the body / html background using the Solarized palette
#      (Ethan Schoonover's public-domain base03 / base3). This handles
#      the page chrome around the xterm.js terminal — margins, scrollbar
#      gutter, area visible during initial load.
#   3. Injects a <script> (applyAutodarkTheme) that ALSO flips the
#      xterm.js Terminal instance's theme (window.term.options.theme)
#      to match the system color-scheme. This is required because the
#      xterm.js canvas renderer paints its OWN background color over
#      the body chrome — a CSS-only flip leaves the visible terminal
#      area unchanged even though getComputedStyle on the body reports
#      the right color (this was the v7 bug caught by the workbot
#      browser-side probe). The script:
#        - reads prefers-color-scheme on initial load,
#        - reapplies on a setInterval poll because ttyd's WebSocket
#          sends a SET_PREFERENCES message AFTER the initial connect
#          that overwrites whatever theme the page set (without the
#          reapply, the terminal flashes to its compile-time default
#          a second after load),
#        - listens for matchMedia change events so live OS theme flips
#          propagate without a page reload.
#
# Output is written in place: index.html is overwritten.

# JS: walks the page for the xterm.js Terminal instance and reapplies
# the theme matching prefers-color-scheme. Runs on:
#   1. initial DOMContentLoaded (catches first paint),
#   2. setInterval(2s) — race-condition reapply (see comment below),
#   3. matchMedia change listener — instant swap if the user toggles
#      system dark mode while the tab is open.
#
# RACE NOTE: ttyd's WebSocket sends a SET_PREFERENCES message AFTER
# the initial connect handshake. The xterm.js client merges that into
# its options and re-paints, OVERWRITING whatever theme we set on
# initial load. The setInterval poll defends against that — every
# couple seconds we re-stamp the correct theme. Cost is negligible
# (one object assignment + a single repaint trigger).
# This mirrors a historical fix used in the maintainer's homelab
# nginx sub_filter injection for the same upstream xterm.js race.
