"""Prometheus exporter for the claude-events file-based event bus.

Reads ~/claude-events/ on every scrape (cheap — usually 0 to a few small
JSON files) and exposes metrics at /metrics on PORT.

Producers (cron jobs, alertmanager webhooks, session-task queue, torrent
done-script, claude-watch alerts) drop JSON files into the queue dir; the
`claude-event-watch` watcher reads + removes them, surfacing each event to
the main loop. This exporter gives us visibility into:

  - Events emitted (per source/tag) — derived from filename timestamps so
    we don't double-count across scrapes
  - Current backlog depth (number of files waiting to be consumed)
  - Age of the oldest unconsumed event (catches a wedged main loop /
    dead claude-event-watch watcher)

Cardinality is bounded: source/tag values not in the known-good set are
collapsed into "other".

Metrics:
  - claude_events_total{source,tag}              counter (events ever seen by exporter)
  - claude_events_queue_depth                    gauge  (files in queue dir right now)
  - claude_events_age_seconds                    gauge  (age of oldest queued event)
  - claude_events_processed_total{outcome}       counter (consumed = total_seen - depth)
  - claude_events_dir_last_modified              gauge  (mtime of queue dir)
  - claude_events_scrape_errors_total            counter
